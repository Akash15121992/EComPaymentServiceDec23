1. API -> doPayment
Request Body -> all the required details

API would would be called from OrderService

Order -> Product -> PaymentGateway -> payment link is received , open the link to do the payment

1. What details are received from Order Service?
2. Once we get the entry to payment service , before calling the payment gateway , insert a payment entry
inside the Payment table in Payment service status will be in progress
3. Once the payment is done , we will have callback URL on payment service
4. This callback URL will update the entry made on payment table earlier i.e update the payment status when
payment request was done.
5 . Extra calls we need to do will be in the flow of callback url.
